<p id="starwars">Disney and Lucasfilm's Solo: A Star Wars Story struggled in its debut at the Memorial Day box office, where it came in well behind expectations with a three-day debut of $84.8 million and four-day debut of $103 million, according to Monday numbers. That's even worse than Friday forecasts. The news is altogether grim overseas, where Solo rolled out in every major market save Japan. The movie — which made a high-profile stop at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this month — is bombing with $65 million, including a dismal $10.1 million launch in China. </p>
